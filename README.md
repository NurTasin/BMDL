## Introduction
BMDL is an open source project for backing up your files that you care about from your all devices.

Just you have to run `BMDL Server` app (coming soon) on a device. This device running `BMDL Server` will act like a server and all the files will be backed up in this device. And on all the other devices you have to run `BMDL Client` (coming soon). These devices will send their files to the device which is running `BMDL Server`
